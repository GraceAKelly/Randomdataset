# Randomdataset

Random Data Set Generation.ipynb was created using a Jupyter notebook for the simulation of a data set using Python based on a real-world phenomenon.
The data is modeled on manufacturing data of 100 synthesised batches across four variables status location, name of person responsible, the batch status and a target date.

The notebook explains the distribution of the four variables and their relationship with each other.

The data set is displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
